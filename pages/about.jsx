        Hello, I'm Vaishnavi Dwivedi. ðŸ‘‹ </p>
        
        <p className='boday-about'>I'm a full-stack product designer (and Developer/Design Advocate) based in Mumbai, India. My journey into product design is quite similar to many who transitioned to this field after being a software developer. </p>
      
        <p className='boday-about'>I've done UX Research in all of my developer internships since most of them were at startups. I've helped my teams design several opensource projects and conducted 40+ workshops (as of Jan 2022) specific to hands-on work with Figma, Design Thinking and Product Strategy.</p>
    
        <p className='boday-about'>My curiousity helps me to be open-minded towards feedback, filliing me with the eagerness to ask questions, and iterate towards a better product.
